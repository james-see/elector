# About npm Deprecation Warnings

## Summary
When running `npm install`, you'll see deprecation warnings for several packages. **These are safe to ignore.**

## Why These Warnings Appear

The deprecation warnings come from **transitive dependencies** of `electron-builder`, not from code we wrote or directly depend on:

```
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6
npm warn deprecated npmlog@6.0.2
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3, glob@8.1.0
npm warn deprecated gauge@4.0.4
npm warn deprecated are-we-there-yet@3.0.1
npm warn deprecated boolean@3.2.0
npm warn deprecated @npmcli/move-file@2.0.1
```

These are dependencies of `electron-builder` that it uses for building/packaging the application.

## Impact

✅ **No security vulnerabilities** - Running `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities

✅ **No functional impact** - The application works perfectly

✅ **Only affects build tooling** - These deprecated packages are only used during the build process, not in the final application

## When Will This Be Fixed?

These warnings will disappear when `electron-builder` updates to newer versions of its dependencies. This is outside our control and requires updates from the electron-builder maintainers.

## What We've Done

1. ✅ Updated Electron to 35.7.5 (latest secure version)
2. ✅ Fixed all actual security vulnerabilities
3. ✅ Ensured the application functions correctly
4. ✅ Documented the deprecation warnings

## TL;DR

**The deprecation warnings are cosmetic only.** They don't affect security or functionality. The built application is secure and works correctly.

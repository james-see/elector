- **Resolves Issue #3**: Sandboxing chromium to make it secure from XSS

### üöÄ CI/CD & Automation
- **GitHub Actions** workflow for automated builds on push to master
- Multi-platform builds: macOS (DMG/ZIP), Linux (AppImage/DEB), Windows (EXE)
- Automated release creation with version tagging
- Build artifacts automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases

### üì¶ Dependency Updates
- Upgraded from `electron-prebuilt` 0.28.2 to `electron` 33.2.0
- Added `electron-builder` 25.1.8 for cross-platform builds
- Modern Node.js compatibility (tested with Node 22+)

### üìù Code Modernization

  - Modern `app.whenReady()` pattern
- Enhanced security in webPreferences configuration
- Improved code structure and documentation

### üìñ Documentation
- Updated README with security improvements
- Added installation instructions for all platforms
- Added build instructions
- Clarified Tor prerequisites
- Added link to automated releases

### üêõ Issue Management
- **Closed #3** (sandboxing/XSS) - ‚úÖ Resolved with security updates
- **Closed #4** (Chromium add-ons) - Not planned, out of scope
- **Closed #6** (Project status) - Updated with v2.0 status
- **Closed #7** (Human-friendly addresses) - Out of scope
- **Kept #5 open** (Custom Tor ports) - Valid enhancement for future

### üîÑ Migration Notes
If upgrading from v1.x:
1. Run `npm install` to get new dependencies
2. Tor must be running on 127.0.0.1:9050 (default)
3. Modern Electron requires newer Node.js (v18+)
4. Old React components still use deprecated APIs - will need updates in future releases

### Known Limitations
- React components still use old JSX transformer (needs React upgrade)
- No settings UI yet (hardcoded Tor proxy settings)
- Requires manual Tor installation and setup

### Coming Soon
- Settings UI for configurable Tor ports (Issue #5)
- Modern React upgrade
- Additional security hardening
